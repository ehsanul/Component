Code isn't always perfectly hierarchical, like classical inheritance assumes.
Component.coffee is the tiny library you turn to when classical inheritance
isn't enough.

It provides an easy way to create composable bits of functionality, which you can
later put together in arbitrary ways to make new components. This can help keep
your code structured in a more natural way, keeping it more DRY.
